# Rock Paper Scissor game

Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

I decided to try out this RPS game with the computer. Here are some features..

- The computer can randomly choose a shape.
- And the computer choice is showing graphically.
- Users can pick a choice by clicking a shape.
- Scores will be calculated while playing.
- Winner will be displayed when the round is over.
